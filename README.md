The WGET-PowerShell script provides a versatile tool for downloading website content recursively in PowerShell. With the recent update, users can now take advantage of the Get-HelpCommands function to easily access information about available commands directly within the script. This enhancement aims to improve user experience by offering a quick reference to command functionalities. Additionally, a remote script execution example is provided in the README.md to guide users on fetching and executing the script directly from the GitHub repository.
